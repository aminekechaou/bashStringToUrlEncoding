# bashStringToUrlEncoding
Convert any string with Url Encoding

Use with:

./urlConversionMac.sh "String to encode here"

Works with special characters and is especially useful for passing  domain names containing backslashes and secure passwords that contain special characters on mac computers, because it needs the url encoding.
